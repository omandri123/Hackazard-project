# 🚀 TAS- Training Agent System

## 📌 Problem Statement 1 – Weave AI magic with Groq

---

## 🎯 Objective

We can prepare for exams for years using books and lectures.
But what about interviews?

An interview is not just a test of knowledge—it’s a test of presence, communication, confidence, and behavior. These are physical and psychological traits you can’t just read about. You need real-time practice and feedback.

That’s where TAS – The Training Agent System comes in.

TAS is built around two major objectives:

1. Lack of Constructive Feedback: After most interviews, candidates are either placed or rejected without knowing why. There's no meaningful feedback that helps them learn or grow from the experience.


2. No Dedicated and Optimized Training Tool: While there are platforms for interview prep, they often lack real-time analysis and detailed, personalized feedback.

Solutions provided by TAS:

Solution to Objective 1: Training Agent Mode
This mode is designed for real interviews. The HR or interviewer can launch TAS in Training Agent Mode, enter the candidate's name, and set the judgment criteria. TAS then automatically accesses the system’s camera and microphone to start analyzing the candidate’s posture, facial expressions, and speech in real-time.
Once the interview ends, the HR simply stops the session. All collected data is processed and sent to GROQ AI, which generates a comprehensive feedback report—complete with performance scores, behavioral analysis, graphs, and improvement suggestions. This detailed PDF report can then be handed over to the candidate as a learning resource.

Solution to Objective 2: Interview Training Mode
This mode is for self-practice and preparation. The candidate can launch Interview Training Mode, enter their name and the purpose of the interview (e.g., job role, company, domain), and TAS will fetch a tailored set of interview questions generated by GROQ AI.
As the candidate answers each question, TAS analyzes facial expressions, posture, voice tone, and speech quality. After the session, it generates a detailed performance report in PDF format—including rankings, graphical summaries, and actionable feedback—helping candidates track their growth and focus on areas that need improvement.
